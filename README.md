# Recommendation System (Deprecated)
1.	Using the Tastedive API, I was able to allow the user to get recommendations for their favourite genres of Movies and search for similar movies. 
2.	In this program, the user inputs his favourite movie or show or he could check out the rating of a particular show. 
3.	After he provides an input, the Tastedive API provides a result in the form of JSON. The program parses the JSON and returns a readable output to the user.
